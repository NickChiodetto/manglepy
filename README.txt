In order to make use of mangle_utils, the library has to first be
compiled. The C source code (generated by cython) should have been
included with mangle, so all you should need to do is step 2, unless
you have changed mangle_utils.pyx, in which case the C needs to be
regenerated (step 1).

1) To generate C sources (you should not have to do this), run this:
   cython -a mangle_utils.pyx

2) To build the mangle_utils library, run this:
   python setup.py build_ext --inplace
